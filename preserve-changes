Great! If you want to **keep the changes from a commit but remove the commit itself**, the cleanest way is to use `git reset` and then stage the changes manually. Here's how to do it:

---

### ðŸ§¤ Preserve Changes, Remove Commit

1. **Soft reset to move HEAD**
   This keeps the changes in your working directory:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
   Replace `HEAD~1` with the commit you want to remove (e.g. `HEAD~2` for two commits back).

   âœ… This removes the commit but leaves the changes staged.

2. **Optional: Unstage the changes**
   If you want the changes unstaged (in working dir only):
   ```bash
   git reset
   ```

3. **Create a new commit**
   You can now recommit the preserved changes with a cleaner message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "New commit with preserved changes"
   ```

4. **Force push to remote**
   Since history changed:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name> --force
   ```
